This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React Boilerplate

This project isn't so much as a "boilerplate" as it is a place to store all the libraries I may commonly use with react.

I find myself flying/offline a lot lately, so this is a quick project that I can clone/copy around on my local machine for use while offline.

```sh
git clone repo_name

# If yarn
yarn install

# If npm
npm install
```

I'll occasionally be adding other libraries I want to try out over time.
